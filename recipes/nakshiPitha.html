            <li>Water 2.5 cups</li>
            <li>Salt to taste</li>
            <li>Rice flour 2 cups</li>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring water to a boil in a medium-sized saucepan. Add salt to taste, stir and mix.</li>
            <li>Once the water starts to boil, add rice flour. Stir and cover with lid.</li>
            <li>Turn off heat and let it sit under the closed lid for 10 mins.</li>
            <li>Remove lid and mix everything together, allow it to cool down to room temperature before kneading.</li>
            <li>Knead well for couple minutes to form a smooth and soft dough. Divide the dough into smaller equal portions.</li>
            <li>Brush oil on the rolling surface and on top of dough, flatten and roll out to a thick flat circle.</li>
            <li>Using a toothpick or a similar pointy object, cut and design into pitha shape. Remember to practice enough times to perfect the designs!</li>
            <li>Deep fry the pithas in medium hot oil until they are golden brown. Remove from oil and drain excess oil on paper towel.</li>
            <li>Make syrup in a separate saucepan, add 1 cup sugar and 1/2 cup water. Stir and cook until the sugar dissolves completely. Add 1 tsp of honey to avoid crystallization.</li>
            <li>Add the nokshi pithas and coat evenly on both sides.</li>
            <li>Remove and serve in a plate.</li>
        </ol>
